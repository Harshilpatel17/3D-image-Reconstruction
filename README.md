we have introduced the framework for the reconstruction of single-view 3D mesh.  Here, we  have broken down the process  into  3  parts,  in  the  first  phase generation of a 3D point cloud from a 2D image process is done by DBSCAN clustering algorithm. After that algorithm is applied, we get the 3D point cloud. In the second Phase creation of a 3D mesh from the 3D point cloud process is done. In the third and final phase, In the optimization of 3D  mesh, we used Adam optimizer and as a loss function, we used MSE  for  a  better model. This limitation underscores the importance of    considering    multi-view    approaches    for    more comprehensive    3D    reconstructions    along    with    differential    rendering    in    future    iterations    of the methodology.  The  findings  of  our  study  suggest  that the reduction of noise and the need for careful computation to produce an accurate depth map for the image has to be done perfectly to achieve the desired accuracy level. However, the obtained precision is great enough to make the process of creating a 3D model easier. Using a Deep Learning (DL) model, such as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), for  depth  map  estimation  and  feature extraction is suggested as a potential direction for future research.  Furthermore,  there  is  potential  to  improve the 3D  model  creation  process  with  the  application  of  a Model,   as   demonstrated   by   Generative Adversarial   Networks   (GANs)   for   the   single   image dataset.
